1. get the things needed with `pip install discord.py translate nltk langdetect python-dotenv aiohttp syllables pydub SpeechRecognition`
2. create .env and add in TOKEN=BOT.TOKEN_12345 with "BOT.TOKEN_12345" being your bot's token
3. run bot.py (python bot.py)

   its as shrimple as that, except wait
   to enable AI, you need to link the bot to an ollama server, its automatically set up to the default ollama address, but if you run the server seporately from the bot, you'll need to configure that
   and to set up the bot, you need to use various commands. ask @mari2 on discord if you really can't figure it out. Remember to tell me why you added me if you add me.
